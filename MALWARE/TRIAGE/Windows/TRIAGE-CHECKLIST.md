# MALWARE TRIAGE
 This file is a check-list for malware triage, it will constantly be changed and improved, the current one is just a bare bone one size fit's all list and is NOT field ready.



## TRIAGE CHECKLIST 


+ File Context and Delivery
+ File Information & Header Analysis
+ Get Basic PE information
+ Simple Search
+ Collect Strings
+ Check AV vendors
+ Quick VM Detonation
+ Capture network information

## CHECKLIST MORE INFO

### File Context and Delivery

When you receive the malware binary, it's important to ask how the malware got there in the first place.

Questions to ask:

+ Did it come from an email?
+ Did it come from a browser download?
+ Was it quarantined in an Anti-Virus?
+ Is it an anomalous process running?

### File Information & Header Analysis

+ Use a file command to determine the file type
+ Verify the file header using a hex editor like HxD

### Get Basic PE information

+ Parse the PE header using tools like PE Bear
+ Determine what resources, DLL imports, and libraries used
+ Example: If you see Ws2_32.dll it might be setting up a network connection because it's used for setting up sockets

### Simple Search

+ Calculate the hash of the file and check the web to see if it's been seen already

### Collect Strings

+ Using the string command in linux or BinText tool, extract the strings to find any clues

### Check AV vendors

+ Run the file against an Anti-Virus or VirusTotal to see if there are any detections. 

IMPORTANT NOTE!: THE FILE WILL GET STORED AT VT IF SUBMITTED, DO NOT SUBMITT FILES BLINDLY, 

IN CASE OF TARGETED ATTACK, THE ATTACKER WILL LIKELY KNOW IF DISCOVERED IF YOU DO.


##

### Quick VM Detonation

There's two ways to go about htis
+ set up your own VM with all the required monitoring tools and such
+ Use open source VM detonation services like hybrid-analysis.com or malwr.com to get the behavior quickly

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING SERVICES: THIS WILL ALSO LIKELY MAKE THE FILE AND RESULT PUBLIC AVAILABLE TO OTHERS, SO THINK TWICE IF YOU WANT TO DO SO

### Capture network information

+ Use the VM detonation service to capture any network connections or packet data.
+ If you can't do this then we will need to dynamically debug the malware.
