## KAZU-RE-MALWARE-NOTES


This repo is for all of the various notes in regards to RE and MALWARE analysis, and this Repo is currently made public purely for the reason to have more of my own repo's on github and show what i am currently working on

Due to the nature of everything, RE and Malware topics will have a lot of tools and methods which overlap, so some things may appear multiple times in both.

Additionally, while there's a lot of things i know, there's also a lot of things i don't remember as much or things i never got around to fully learn the details of and so forth, so to make sure i manage to get as much correct details down as possible about everything, i decided to go over every matter one at a time and write various information down about it as i go along, 

also, since i am systematically going trough material i have about various topics, there's will naturally in the beginning be a lot of information taken from just a few sources, and while i try write a lot of things in my own words when possible, a lot of things are just factual(such as how hardware and OS work), and thus is more or less just direct pull from the source text itself.

With time, the notes will naturally be more diversily sourced as well as have more of my own personal notes, already exisiting notes will also likely be re-written as well and so forth

In regards to my sources, please check the "sources" file.

to avoid pushing for every minor change, i will attempt to only push monthly or when i feel i got enough content to warrant a push(whichever comes first), also, how much change have occured since last update is indicated by the update version which use "X.X.X" format, less updated, less increase with only major increase in number when a lot have been updated since last major number.

### PLEASE NOTE!: EVERYTHING FOUND IN THIS REPO IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE IS NOT FINAL, ACCURATE OR FREE OF TYPO'S AS I AM LITERALLY WRITING EVERYTHING AS I GO WITH MORE FOCUS ON GETTING SOMETHING DOWN THEN MAKING EVERYTHING PROPER(FOR NOW A LEAST), 

#### Also, as i am still trying to figure out what the best way to format everything and what works and what does not work, a lot of things such as layout will be inconsistent.
