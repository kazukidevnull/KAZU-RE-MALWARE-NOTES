# MALWARE TRIAGE NOTES

This document will have more extensive notes regarding various things found in the "TRIAGE-CHECKLIST", everything is tried to be kept to the order of operations as best as possible so when you read this document you should be able to go down the document in the order each task should be done without having to jumo all over the place, 

however, sometimes the best order of everything is not always easy to determine and there will be things that are added which later are found out to not be a good idea, being in wrong order or just simple not being as much help with something as first believed, so things will change around and be improved all the time

For each of later reference there will be multiple sections for each stage 

Each section will also have a list of tools that can be used for the task with "<!>" in front of the recommended tool for the tasks, more details on what each tool can do and how to use various features and such can be found in the MALTOOLS document

## FOR PE FILES


### Check Hash and PE Header

First generate a hash of the file using tools like "hashmyfiles" or similar, and then check if the file is already submitted to VT, if it is, take note of all the information available there, depending on how many times it have been submitted, various comments on it, the score and so forth, you may be able to call it done already here depending what you role duty is and where you found it.

If VT turns up empty or does not answer all the questions you have, then you may want to use tools like PE-Bear to check it's imports, sections and so forth
