High: This indicate the the rule have less then 20% false positive, this means that if you get hit on there rules, there's a high certainty that it's something bad

Med: This indicate the rule have less then 40% false positive, hits on these rules are things that are seen used by criminals and pentesters but also have legit users, what this means it's something bad likely is up, but not always.

Low: This indicate the the rule have 60% or more false positive, hits on these are very prone to false positive as it's very common legitimate things which is sometimes used for bad or abused, so these rules can sometimes spot bad things before it escalate to something more serious, so if you get the hits on these and context says you shouldn't, then it is worth checking out.
