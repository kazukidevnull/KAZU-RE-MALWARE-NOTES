## RE-Malware tools list

Due to the similarity and tools used for both malware analysis and RE, it can sometimes be impossible to say for sure if a tool should be placed in the tool list for malware analysis or RE in general, so instead of having to try decide and also to avoid me having to create multiple list with duplicate information, i have decided to just create this list which will have all in one document and just place each tool in their appropiate sections

everything should be self-explainatory below, but some important things to note, the document start with a index of all the tools placed in to their own section, if a tool can be used both for Malware and RE, then it goes into the "Malware/RE" list, and then below under the "Tools Details" section you can write more detailed information about the tool, it's usage and so forth. 

Each tool should be in table form and have the following information(in this order), TOOL NAME, CATEGORY, SYSTEM(WIN or LINUX), DESCRIPTION(optional), AUHTOR(optional), LINK(optional), NOTES(optional)


Category explainations(Updated as needed): 

| Category | Description |
| ----- | ------ |
| Analyzer | These Tools are used to quickly scan & analyse a file to gain insighful information, these tools are normally purpose specific, Features that is part of another tool(such as IDA/Ghidra) does not come into this category |
| Debugger | Thses tools are known as debugging tool and |

--------------------------------------------------------

### Malware tools

These are tools which are primary used for malware analysis, while they can help with reversing in general, that is not their main purpose.

| Category | Name | System | Description | Author | Link | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| parser | YarGen | win/linux | Yara Rule Generator | Florian Roth |https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen | |
| analyser | peframe | windows | ||||

### Malware/RE tool

| Category | Name | System | Description | Author | Link | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| Analyzer | PEiD | Windows | Tool used to analyse PE header for informations including packers used, compiler, etc | Markus& laszlo | | | |
| Analyzer | CFF Explorer | Windows | This tool parses more information from the PE file then PEiD and able to detect the compiler/packer that's used there (and it can be more accurate than PEiD) | author | | | |
| Debugger | OllyDbg | Windows | the best known debugger in the Windows platform, and its UI has become the standard for most Windows debuggers | | | will not work with 64-bit binary, use the 64 version for that |
| Debugger | Immunity Debugger | Windows | This is basically a scriptable clone of OllyDbg, and was created mainly for exploitation and bug hunting | | | |
| Debugger | x64dbg | Windows !  This is a debugger for x86 and x64 executables with a very similar (if not identical) interface to OllyDbg. It's also an open source debugger | | | |
| parsers | PEBear | Windows | Parses the PE headers, Explores Resources & Unpacks UPX | | | |
