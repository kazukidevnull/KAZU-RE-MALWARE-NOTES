## This document related to notes regarding doing RE of ELF(Executable and Linkable Format) files and have information which is helpful to know when dealing with ELF files


A ELF file defines the structure for binaries, libraries, and core files. The formal specification allows the operating system to interpreter its underlying machine instructions correctly. 

ELF files are typically the output of a compiler or linker and are a binary format

It's compatible with most linux systems and is basically a linux version of "exe" for windows

A ELF file are not just for binaries and executeables but can also be used for partial pieces(object codes), libraries and core dumps(those core and a.out files), the ELF specification is also used for kernal itself and other linux kernal modules


### STRUCTURE

The structure of a ELF file varies, but consist of a 
+ ELF Header
+ File Data

By using the "readelf" command, it's possible to read the Header of the ELF file which will output the following information
+ Magic: The Magic string provides information about the file and is the source for rest of the information displayed
+ Class:
+ Data:
+ Version:
+ IS/ABI:
+ ABI Version:
+ Type:
+ Machine:
+ Version(not a typo):
+ Entry Point Address:
+ Start of program headers:
+ Flags:
+ Size of this header:
+ Size of program headers:
+ Number of program headers:
+ Section header string table index:

### Details

#### Magic

first 4 hexadecimal parts define if it's an ELF file (45=E,4c=L,46=F), prefixed with the 7f value

#### Class

This value indicates the architecture for the filewhich can be either 32-bit(=01) or 64-bit(=02)

#### Data 

This field idicate if the data is in LSB(Least Significent Bit) which is "01" or MSB(Most Significient Bit) which is "02"

#### Version

the version number indicate the version number, since there's currently only one, this will mostly stay the same amongst all files

#### OS/ABI
