### CHECKLIST MORE INFO

#### File Context and Delivery

When you receive the malware binary, it's important to ask how the malware got there in the first place.

Questions to ask:

+ Did it come from an email?
+ Did it come from a browser download?
+ Was it quarantined in an Anti-Virus?
+ Is it an anomalous process running?

#### File Information & Header Analysis

+ Use a file command (sniffer VM) to determine the file type
+ Verify the file header using a hex editor (HxD)

#### Get Basic PE information

+ Parse the PE header using the tool PE Bear
+ Determine what resources, DLL imports, and libraries used
+ Example: If you see Ws2_32.dll it might be setting up a network connection because it's used for setting up sockets

#### Simple Search

+ Calculate the hash of the file and check the web to see if it's been seen already

#### Collect Strings

+ Using the string command in linux or BinText tool, extract the strings to find any clues

#### Check AV vendors

+ Run the file against an Anti-Virus or VirusTotal to see if there are any detections

#### Quick VM Detonation

+ Use open source VM detonation services like hybrid-analysis.com or malwr.com to get the behavior quickly

#### Capture network information

+ Use the VM detonation service to capture any network connections or packet data.
+ If you can't do this then we will need to dynamically debug the malware.
