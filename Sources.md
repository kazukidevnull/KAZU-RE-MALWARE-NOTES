## SOurces list

This document have information about various sources i used for my notes, of course, while i would liked to list EVERY source, due to the large and diverse pool of possible sources for all kinds of information, it's not possible to list everyone who says anything related to RE/Malware as then this list would need to be thousands upon thousand names long with hundreds getting added every month

what this document will have is list of books, sites and other sources which either was used extensively, was directly quoted, had information not "commonly" included in other similar sources on the topic, or is a exclusively source of said infomration(ex. someone found and disclosed new information).




### Major sources

This list have sources which was used extensively troughout various notes and had a big impact on what notes was included, due to this, is unfeasable to note every time it was used for source as it will likely be mixed with a lof of other major sources and come to a point where even multiple major sources are combined so no all information come from some source.

+ Mastering Malware analysis: This is a book i got trough a humblebundle packt deal which i remembered i had when i started this note project and this was the first to to be used, i have no idea if this is good or worse then other books as i literally just pulled it at random as the first book.
